To use [Eris](https://npm.im/eris), you just need to wrap your eris client with `createErisCompat` function from discord-player. This function will return a new client proxy which mimics the Discord.js client.

```js title="index.js"
const { Player, createErisCompat } = require('discord-player');
const Eris = require('eris');

const client = new Eris('...');
const player = new Player(createErisCompat(client));
```

<Callout>
  Because this is a proxy, the original client will not be mutated.
