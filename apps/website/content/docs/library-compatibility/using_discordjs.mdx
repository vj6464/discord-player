Discord Player by default supports Discord.js client. To use Discord Player with Discord.js, you just need to pass the Discord.js client instance to the `Player` constructor.

```js title="index.js"
const { Player } = require('discord-player');

const client = new Discord.Client({
  // Make sure you have 'GuildVoiceStates' intent enabled
  intents: ['GuildVoiceStates' /* Other intents */],
});

const player = new Player(client);
```
