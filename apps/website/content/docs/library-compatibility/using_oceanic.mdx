To use [oceanic](https://npm.im/oceanic.js), you just need to wrap your Oceanic client with `createOceanicCompat` function from discord-player. This function will return a new client proxy which mimics the Discord.js client.

```js title="index.js"
const { Player, createOceanicCompat } = require('discord-player');
const { Client } = require('oceanic.js');

const client = new Client({
  auth: 'Bot ...',
  gateway: {
    intents: ['GUILD_VOICE_STATES' /* Other intents */],
  },
});

const player = new Player(createOceanicCompat(client));
```

<Callout>
  Because this is a proxy, the original client will not be mutated.
