---

Discord Player supports various audio filters. There are 4 types of audio filters in discord-player.

### FFmpeg

The most common and powerful method is FFmpeg. It supports a lot of audio filters. To set ffmpeg filter, you can do:

```js title="nightcore.js"
await queue.filters.ffmpeg.toggle(['bassboost', 'nightcore']);
```

Note that there can be a delay between filters transition in this method.

### Equalizer

This equalizer is very similar to Lavalink's 15 Band Equalizer. To use this, you can do:

```js title="bass.js"
queue.filters.equalizer.setEQ([
  { band: 0, gain: 0.25 },
  { band: 1, gain: 0.25 },
  { band: 2, gain: 0.25 },
]);
```

There is no delay between filter transition when using equalizer.

### Biquad

This filter provides digital biquad filterer to the player. To use this, you can do:

```js title="lowpass.js"
import { BiquadFilterType } from 'discord-player';

queue.filters.biquad.setFilter(BiquadFilterType.LowPass);
// similarly, you can use other filters such as HighPass, BandPass, Notch, PeakEQ, LowShelf, HighShelf, etc.
```

There is no delay between filter transition when using biquad filters.

### Resampler

<DevelopmentOnly />

This filter provides resampling to the player. This filter is identical to `await queue.filters.ffmpeg.toggle(..)` with `vaporwave` or `nightcore` filters. To use this, you can do:

```js title="resampler.js"
// resample current audio to 1.3 times the current sample rate
queue.filters.resampler.setSampleRate(48000 * 1.3);

// resample using predefined preset
const enabled = queue.filters.resampler.toggleFilter('nightcore'); // or 'vaporwave'

// currently applied sample rate
console.log(queue.filters.resampler.sampleRate);
```

There is no delay between filter transition when using resampler.

### Other Filters

This is another type of audio filters provider. It currently supports `Tremolo` and `8D` filters only. To use this, you can do:

```js title="8d.js"
queue.filters.filters.setFilters(['8D']);
```

There is no delay between filters transition using this filter.

### Seeker

<DevelopmentOnly />

Discord Player has a built-in filter called `seeker`. This filter is used to seek the audio forward. To use this, you have to explicitly enable it via `nodeOptions`:

```js title="seeker.js"
await player.play(channel, track, {
  nodeOptions: {
    disableSeeker: false,
  },
});
```

Invoking `queue.node.seek()` will use this filter to seek the audio forward. When seeking backwards, the player will fall back to the default behavior of seeking (using FFmpeg).

### Reverb Filter

<DevelopmentOnly />

This filter provides reverb to the player. To use this, you can do:

```js title="reverb.js"
queue.filters.reverb.setReverb({
  roomSize: 0.5,
  damping: 0.5,
  wetLevel: 0.5,
  dryLevel: 0.5,
});
```

There is no delay between filter transition when using reverb filter.

### Compressor Filter

<DevelopmentOnly />

This filter provides compressor to the player. To use this, you can do:

```js title="compressor.js"
queue.filters.compressor.setCompressor({
  threshold: -20,
  ratio: 3,
  attack: 0.1,
  release: 0.1,
  makeupGain: 0,
  kneeWidth: 0,
});
```

There is no delay between filter transition when using compressor filter.
