# Intercepting AudioResource Stream

Discord Player supports intercepting and capturing the audio resource stream and consume it without affecting the playback. This feature is useful for saving the audio stream to a file or whatever you want to do with it.

<Callout type="warn">
  Keep in mind that the audio resource stream you are trying to capture might
  not be legal to store or distribute. Make sure you have the right to store the
  audio stream before proceeding. Stream depends on the extractor you are using.
  Discord Player is not responsible for any misuse of this feature.
</Callout>

## 1. Enabling Stream Intercepting on a GuildQueue

Each queues can define their interception behavior by setting the `enableStreamInterceptor` property to `true` (disabled by default). This property will enable the stream interceptor for the queue and `PlayerStreamInterceptor` will be able to capture this stream.

```js
await player.play(channel, query, {
  nodeOptions: {
    enableStreamInterceptor: true,
  },
});
```

## 2. Using PlayerStreamInterceptor

`PlayerStreamInterceptor` allows you to capture intercepted audio resource stream and consume it. You can use this class to store the audio stream to a file or whatever you want to do with it. You can also define multiple consumers simultaneously.

Interceptor will always execute **after** the `OnAfterCreateStream` hook.

```js
const interceptor = player.createStreamInterceptor({
  async shouldIntercept(queue, track, format, stream) {
    // Return true to intercept the stream, false to skip
    // this is useful if you want to dynamically decide whether to intercept the stream or not based on the track or format or queue
    return true;
  },
});

// this will be called every time an audio resource stream is intercepted
const unsubscribe = interceptor.onStream(
  async (queue, track, format, stream) => {
    const ext = format === StreamType.Opus ? '.opus' : '.pcm';
    const out = fs.createWriteStream(`./${track.title}${ext}`);

    stream.interceptors.add(out);
  },
);

// Unsubscribe the interceptor
unsubscribe();
```

<Callout type="warn">
  You must not use `.pipe()` method on this stream. This affects the audio
  player directly. Instead, use `.interceptors.add()` method to add a writable
  stream. You can add as many interceptors as you want.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Discord Player returns `opus` stream format when ffmpeg is not being used. If
  ffmpeg is being used, the stream format will be `pcm`.
</Callout>

That's it! You have successfully intercepted the audio resource stream and stored it in a file. You can now use this feature to store the audio stream in a database, send it to a server, or whatever you want to do with it. Just make sure to not misuse this feature.
