Discord Player is a robust framework for developing Discord Music bots using JavaScript and TypeScript. It is built on top of the [discord-voip](https://npm.im/discord-voip) library and offers a comprehensive set of customizable tools, making it one of the most feature enrich framework in town.

## Installation

### Before you start

Discord Player requires Discord.js 14.0 or higher. Please ensure that you have a compatible version by running `npm list discord.js` in your terminal. If you're using an earlier version, please update it. The [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide) provides resources to assist you with the update process.

#### Main Library

```package-install
npm install discord-player @discord-player/extractor
```

#### FFmpeg or Avconv

FFmpeg or Avconv is required for media transcoding. You can obtain it from [https://ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org) or via npm.

<Callout type="warn">
  We do not recommend installing `ffmpeg` via npm because binaries pulled from
  npm is known to be unstable. It is recommended to install it from the official
  source.
</Callout>

```package-install
npm install --save ffmpeg-static
# or
npm install --save @ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg
# or
npm install --save @node-ffmpeg/node-ffmpeg-installer
# or
npm install --save ffmpeg-binaries
```

<Callout type="info">
  Use `FFMPEG_PATH` environment variable to load ffmpeg from custom path.
</Callout>

Once you have completed these installations, let's proceed with writing a simple music bot.

### Setup

Let's create a main player instance. This instance handles and keeps track of all the queues and its components.

```js title="index.js"
const { Player } = require('discord-player');
const { DefaultExtractors } = require('@discord-player/extractor');

const client = new Discord.Client({
  // Make sure you have 'GuildVoiceStates' intent enabled
  intents: ['GuildVoiceStates' /* Other intents */],
});

// this is the entrypoint for discord-player based application
const player = new Player(client);

// Now, lets load all the default extractors
await player.extractors.loadMulti(DefaultExtractors);
```

<Callout type="warn">
  We don't recommend assigning `player` to `client` using `client.player =
  player` here. Discord Player provides [hooks](/docs/hooks/using_hooks) (aka
  helper functions) to access discord-player objects at ease.
</Callout>

## Eris Setup

Discord Player has limited support for Eris. You can use the following code to set up Discord Player with Eris:

```js title="index.js"
const { Player, createErisCompat } = require('discord-player');

const player = new Player(createErisCompat(client));
```

Discord Player is mostly events based. It emits different events based on the context and actions. Let's add a basic event listener to notify the user when a track starts to play:

```js title="index.js"
// this event is emitted whenever discord-player starts to play a track
player.events.on('playerStart', (queue, track) => {
  // we will later define queue.metadata object while creating the queue
  queue.metadata.channel.send(`Started playing **${track.title}**!`);
});
```

Let's move on to the command part. You can define the command as per your requirements. We will only focus on the command part:

```js title="play.js"
const { useMainPlayer } = require('discord-player');

export async function execute(interaction) {
  const player = useMainPlayer();
  const channel = interaction.member.voice.channel;
  if (!channel)
    return interaction.reply('You are not connected to a voice channel!'); // make sure we have a voice channel
  const query = interaction.options.getString('query', true); // we need input/query to play

  // let's defer the interaction as things can take time to process
  await interaction.deferReply();

  try {
    const { track } = await player.play(channel, query, {
      nodeOptions: {
        // nodeOptions are the options for guild node (aka your queue in simple word)
        metadata: interaction, // we can access this metadata object using queue.metadata later on
      },
    });

    return interaction.followUp(`**${track.title}** enqueued!`);
  } catch (e) {
    // let's return error if something failed
    return interaction.followUp(`Something went wrong: ${e}`);
  }
}
```

That's all it takes to build your own music bot. Please check out the [Documentation](https://discord-player.js.org) for more features/functionalities.
