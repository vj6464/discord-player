Serialization and Deserialization in discord-player is the process of converting a track or playlist object into a plain json object and vice versa.

## Saving tracks or playlists in a database

You may want to save tracks or playlists in a database to be able to retrieve them later. This also helps your users to save their favorite tracks or playlists, or create a custom playlist. Discord Player offers a built-in way to save and retrieve tracks or playlists in a database.

  Discord Player offers serialization and deserialization of `Track`s and
  `Playlist`s only.

### Saving tracks

To save a track, you will have to first convert Discord Player track object into a plain json object. Discord Player exports a function named
`serialize` which takes a track object and returns a plain json object.

```js title="save-track.js"
import { serialize } from 'discord-player';

const track = MyDiscordPlayerTrack;

const serializedTrack = serialize(track);

await database.save('my-track-name', serializedTrack);
```

You can also encode the track object into a base64 string using the `encode` function.

```js title="save-track.js"
import { encode } from 'discord-player';

const track = MyDiscordPlayerTrack;

const encodedTrackString = encode(serialize(track));

await database.save('my-track-name', encodedTrackString);
```

### Retrieving tracks

To retrieve a track, you will have to first convert the plain json object into a Discord Player track object. Discord Player exports a function named `deserialize` which takes a plain json object and returns a Discord Player track object.

```js title="retrieve-track.js"
import { deserialize } from 'discord-player';

const serializedTrack = await database.get('my-track-name');

const track = deserialize(serializedTrack);

// now this track can be queued like a normal track
```

You can also decode the base64 string into a plain json object using the `decode` function.

```js title="retrieve-track.js"
import { decode } from 'discord-player';

const encodedTrackString = await database.get('my-track-name');

const serializedTrack = decode(encodedTrackString);

const track = deserialize(serializedTrack);

// now this track can be queued like a normal track
```

### Saving playlists

You can use the same method as above to save or retrieve playlists.

### Saving queue

Discord Player does not offer queue serialization. But you can use the following method to serialize tracks under the queue.

```js title="save-queue.js"
import { serialize } from 'discord-player';

const serializedTracks = queue.tracks.map((track) => serialize(track));

await database.save('my-queue', serializedTracks);
```
