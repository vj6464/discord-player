description: Learn how to access the main player instance
---

We have seen a lot of examples where we could assign `Player` to `client.player` for easy access of the `Player` instance. But polluting client like this could be a bad idea:

```js title="index.js"
client.player = player;
```

This would remove intellisense as `client` does not have a property called `player`. To solve this issue, discord-player by default provides `useMainPlayer` hook which can be used to access the main player instance. Once you initialize Player, you can use `useMainPlayer` to access the main player instance:

```js title="play.js"
const { useMainPlayer } = require('discord-player');
const player = useMainPlayer();
```
