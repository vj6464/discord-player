## Cannot find `mediaplex` or `opusscript` or `@discordjs/opus` or `node-opus`

To resolve this issue, you need to install the opus encoder. Use one of the following commands based on your preference:

```package-install
npm i mediaplex
# or
npm i @discordjs/opus
# or
npm i opusscript
# or
npm i node-opus
```

## FFmpeg/Avconv not found

Ensure that you have either `FFmpeg` or `Avconv` available on your system.

### Installing FFmpeg or Avconv

<Callout>
  We do not recommend using static binaries like `ffmpeg-static` as they are not
  always up-to-date or stable and may cause issues.
</Callout>

You have several options to get FFmpeg:

- Download it from the official FFmpeg website: [www.ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- Use the Node Module (ffmpeg-static): [npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-static](https://npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-static) (Note: Using static binaries like `ffmpeg-static` is not recommended)
- You can dockerize your bot with a Node environment (Example : 18.16.0-bullseye) that can have ffmpeg installed. Check Showcase for sample implementations.
- Alternatively, if you prefer using Avconv instead of FFmpeg, install it on your system or place the Avconv executable at the root of your project.

## Audio player stops immediately without errors

This issue is most likely caused by the usage of static binaries like `ffmpeg-static`. We do not recommend using static binaries as they are not always up-to-date or stable and may cause issues. To fix this issue, make sure to install FFmpeg or Avconv on your system.

## Audio player stops after about 30 seconds to 1 minute without errors

This issue is most likely caused by outdated version of `discord-voip`. Make sure you are using the latest version of `discord-voip` and `discord-player`.

## "Something" is not working

If you encounter issues and something isn't functioning correctly, try attaching a `debug` listener to `player.events` to check for any unusual behavior:

```js title="index.js"
const { useMainPlayer } = require('discord-player');

client.once('ready', () => {
  const player = useMainPlayer();

  // generate dependencies report
  console.log(player.scanDeps()); // [!code highlight]
  // ^------ This is similar to discord-voip's `generateDependenciesReport()` function, but with additional informations related to discord-player.

  // log metadata query, search execution, etc.
  player.on('debug', console.log); // [!code highlight]
  // ^------ This shows how your search query is interpreted, if the query was cached, which extractor resolved the query or which extractor failed to resolve, etc.

  // log debug logs of the queue, such as voice connection logs, player execution, streaming process etc.
  player.events.on('debug', (queue, message) =>
    console.log(`[DEBUG ${queue.guild.id}] ${message}`),
  ); // [!code highlight]
  // ^------ This shows how queue handles the track. It logs informations like the status of audio player, streaming process, configurations used, if streaming failed or not, etc.
});
```

If you receive errors such as "something is not a constructor" or "version.split is not a function" or similar, follow these steps:

- If you are using `npm`, remove `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, or any lockfiles you have. Then, run `npm cache clean --force`, or use a similar command for your package manager, and finally run `npm install` (or the install command of your package manager).
- If the above step does not resolve the issue, consider using another package manager like `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`.
