In this guide, we will learn how to create a play command using Discord Player. The play command allows users to play music in a voice channel.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a play command, make sure you have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed on your system. Discord Player uses ffmpeg to transcode audio streams. You may also install ffmpeg from npm, although it is not recommended due to its unstable nature.

```package-install
npm install --save ffmpeg-static
# or
npm install --save @ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg
# or
npm install --save @node-ffmpeg/node-ffmpeg-installer
# or
npm install --save ffmpeg-binaries
```

## Design Planning

Before we dive into the code, let's plan the design of our play command:

1. **Command Definition**: We will define a new slash command named `play` using `SlashCommandBuilder`.
2. **Option Handling**: The command will have a required option named `song` to specify the song to play.
3. **Player Instance**: We will use the `useMainPlayer` hook to get the player instance.
4. **Permission Checks**: We will check if the user is in a voice channel and if the bot has the necessary permissions.
5. **Playing**: We will play the requested song in the user's voice channel.
6. **Response**: We will send a confirmation message indicating the song has been added to the queue.

### Step 1: Define the Command

First, we need to define the play command using `SlashCommandBuilder`.

```js title="play.js"
// Import necessary classes from discord.js
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';

// Define the play command
export const data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName('play') // Command name
  .setDescription('Play a song in a voice channel') // Command description
  .addStringOption(
    (option) =>
      option
        .setName('song') // Option name
        .setDescription('The song to play') // Option description
        .setRequired(true), // Make the option required
  );
```

### Step 2: Get the Player Instance and Song Query

Next, we need to get the player instance and the song query from the user.

```js title="play.js"
// Import the useMainPlayer function from discord-player
import { useMainPlayer } from 'discord-player';

// Define the execute function for the play command
export async function execute(interaction) {
  // Get the player instance
  const player = useMainPlayer();
  // Get the song query from the user input
  const query = interaction.options.getString('song', true);
}
```

### Step 3: Check User and Bot Permissions

We need to check if the user is in a voice channel and if the bot has the necessary permissions.

```js title="play.js"
// Import necessary classes from discord.js
import { PermissionsBitField } from 'discord.js';

// Define the execute function for the play command
export async function execute(interaction) {
  // Get the player instance and song query
  const player = useMainPlayer();
  const query = interaction.options.getString('song', true);

  // Get the voice channel of the user
  const voiceChannel = interaction.member.voice.channel;

  // Check if the user is in a voice channel
  if (!voiceChannel) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'You need to be in a voice channel to play music!',
    );
  }

  // Check if the bot is already playing in a different voice channel
  if (
    interaction.guild.members.me.voice.channel &&
    interaction.guild.members.me.voice.channel !== voiceChannel
  ) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'I am already playing in a different voice channel!',
    );
  }

  // Check if the bot has permission to join the voice channel
  if (
    !interaction.guild.members.me.permissions.has(
      PermissionsBitField.Flags.Connect,
    )
  ) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'I do not have permission to join your voice channel!',
    );
  }

  // Check if the bot has permission to speak in the voice channel
  if (
    !interaction.guild.members.me
      .permissionsIn(voiceChannel)
      .has(PermissionsBitField.Flags.Speak)
  ) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'I do not have permission to speak in your voice channel!',
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Play the Song

Finally, we need to play the song and handle any errors that may occur.

```js title="play.js"
// Define the execute function for the play command
export async function execute(interaction) {
  // Get the player instance and song query
  const player = useMainPlayer();
  const query = interaction.options.getString('song', true);

  // Get the voice channel of the user and check permissions
  const voiceChannel = interaction.member.voice.channel;

  if (!voiceChannel) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'You need to be in a voice channel to play music!',
    );
  }

  if (
    interaction.guild.members.me.voice.channel &&
    interaction.guild.members.me.voice.channel !== voiceChannel
  ) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'I am already playing in a different voice channel!',
    );
  }

  if (
    !voiceChannel
      .permissionsFor(interaction.guild.members.me)
      .has(PermissionsBitField.Flags.Connect)
  ) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'I do not have permission to join your voice channel!',
    );
  }

  if (
    !voiceChannel
      .permissionsFor(interaction.guild.members.me)
      .has(PermissionsBitField.Flags.Speak)
  ) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'I do not have permission to speak in your voice channel!',
    );
  }

  try {
    // Play the song in the voice channel
    const result = await player.play(voiceChannel, query, {
      nodeOptions: {
        metadata: { channel: interaction.channel }, // Store text channel as metadata on the queue
      },
    });

    // Reply to the user that the song has been added to the queue
    return interaction.reply(
      `${result.track.title} has been added to the queue!`,
    );
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors that occur
    console.error(error);
    return interaction.reply('An error occurred while playing the song!');
  }
}
```

### Handling Track Lifecycle Events

You can also handle track lifecycle events to send messages when a track starts or finishes playing.

```js title="index.js"
// Import necessary classes from discord-player
import { GuildQueueEvent } from 'discord-player';

// Handle the event when a track starts playing
player.events.on(GuildQueueEvent.PlayerStart, async (queue, track) => {
  // Get the metadata stored on the queue
  const { channel } = queue.metadata;
  // Send a message to the channel
  await channel.send(`Now playing: ${track.title}`);
});

// Handle the event when a track finishes playing
player.events.on(GuildQueueEvent.PlayerFinish, async (queue, track) => {
  // Get the metadata stored on the queue
  const { channel } = queue.metadata;
  // Send a message to the channel
  await channel.send(`Finished playing ${track.title}`);
});
```

That's it! You have successfully created a play command using Discord Player. You can now play music in your Discord bot.
