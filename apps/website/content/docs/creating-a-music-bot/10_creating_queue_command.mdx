In this guide, we will learn how to create a queue command in your Discord bot using Discord Player. The queue command will display the current queue of tracks in the voice channel.

```js title="queue.js"
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';
import { useQueue } from 'discord-player';

export const data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName('queue') // Command name
  .setDescription('Display the current queue'); // Command description

export async function execute(interaction) {
  // Get the current queue
  const queue = useQueue();

  if (!queue) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'This server does not have an active player session.',
    );
  }

  // Get the current track
  const currentTrack = queue.current;

  // Get the upcoming tracks
  const upcomingTracks = queue.tracks.slice(0, 5);

  // Create a message with the current track and upcoming tracks
  const message = [
    `**Now Playing:** ${currentTrack.title} - ${currentTrack.author}`,
    '',
    '**Upcoming Tracks:**',
    ...upcomingTracks.map(
      (track, index) => `${index + 1}. ${track.title} - ${track.author}`,
    ),
  ].join('\n');

  // Send the message
  return interaction.reply(message);
}
```

import { useQueue } from 'discord-player';

export const data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName('queue') // Command name
  .setDescription('Display the current queue'); // Command description

  const queue = useQueue(interaction.guild);

  if (!queue) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'This server does not have an active player session.',
    );

  // Get the current track
  const currentTrack = queue.current;

  // Get the upcoming tracks
  const upcomingTracks = queue.tracks.slice(0, 5);

  // Create a message with the current track and upcoming tracks
  const message = [
    `**Now Playing:** ${currentTrack.title} - ${currentTrack.author}`,
    '',
    '**Upcoming Tracks:**',
    ...upcomingTracks.map(
      (track, index) => `${index + 1}. ${track.title} - ${track.author}`,

  // Send the message

<Callout type="warn">
  In the example above, we are only displaying the current track and the next 5
  upcoming tracks to keep things minimal and easy to understand. You can modify
  the number of upcoming tracks to display by changing the `slice` method
  argument. You may also handle pagination if you have a large number of tracks
  in the queue.
</Callout>

In this example:

- We define a new slash command named `queue` using `SlashCommandBuilder`.
- We use the `useQueue` hook to get the current queue.
- If there is no active player session, we reply with an appropriate message.
- We get the current track and upcoming tracks from the queue.
- We create a message with the current track and upcoming tracks and send it as a reply.
