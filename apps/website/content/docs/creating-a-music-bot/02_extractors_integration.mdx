title: Extractors Integration
description: Learn how to integrate extractors in Discord Player
---

Discord Player on itself does not provide a way to resolve the query to a track. It requires you to provide extractors (or plugins) to resolve your input to a track. Extractors are the plugins that provide the ability to resolve the query to a track. Extractors may or may not support audio extraction though.

## Design Planning

Before we dive into the code, let's plan the design of our extractors integration:

1. **Extractor Installation**: We will install the `@discord-player/extractor` package.
2. **Extractor Loading**: We will load the default extractors provided by the package.
3. **Custom Extractors**: We will mention the possibility of using community-built extractors.

## Official Extractors

Discord Player provides a set of default extractors that you can use. These extractors are provided by the `@discord-player/extractor` package. You can install it by running:

```package-install
npm install @discord-player/extractor
```

You may also choose to not use the default extractors and find other extractors that suit your needs. The official extractor package provides the following extractors:

| Extractor               | Description                                                                                          | Supports Streaming | Supports Search |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| `AttachmentExtractor`   | Resolves raw url or local files to playable `Track`                                                  | Yes                | No              |
| `SoundCloudExtractor`   | Resolves SoundCloud url, playlist or album to playable `Track`. Copyrighted tracks cannot be played. | Yes                | Yes             |
| `VimeoExtractor`        | Resolves Vimeo url to playable `Track`.                                                              | Yes                | No              |
| `AppleMusicExtractor`   | Resolves Apple Music url, album or playlist to playable `Track`.                                     | No                 | Yes             |
| `SpotifyExtractor`      | Resolves Spotify url, album or playlist to playable `Track`.                                         | No                 | Yes             |
| `ReverbnationExtractor` | Resolves Reverbnation url to playable `Track`.                                                       | Yes                | No              |

<Callout>
  The extractors that do not support streaming can only be used for search. They
  cannot be used to play the audio. In other words, extractors such as
  `AppleMusicExtractor` and `SpotifyExtractor` can only be used to search for
  tracks, but not to play them.
</Callout>

If the query is resolved via extractors that do not support streaming, Discord Player uses alternative streaming method called **bridging** to facilitate the playback. This method may not be as efficient and accurate.

<Callout>
  Bridging is a method where track extracted by one extractor is passed to
  another extractor that supports streaming. If the track is unable to be
  bridged, Discord Player will skip the track and move to the next track in the
  queue.
</Callout>

## Community Extractors

You can also find community built extractors that provide additional functionality. These extractors may not be officially supported by Discord Player. You can find community extractors on [Community](/community) showcase list.

<Callout type="warn">
  Some extractors may violate the terms of service of the platform they are
  extracting from. Make sure to read the terms of service of the platform before
  using the extractors. Discord Player is not responsible for any violation of
  terms of service, as it gives you full control over the extractors.
</Callout>

## Loading `@discord-player/extractor`

To load the default extractors, you can use the following code:

<Tabs items={['Default Extractors', 'Named Extractors']}>

<Tab value="Default Extractors">

```js
import { DefaultExtractors } from '@discord-player/extractor';

await player.extractors.loadMulti(DefaultExtractors);
```

`DefaultExtractors` is an array of extractors that `@discord-player/extractor` provides. You can also load a single extractor by using `player.extractors.register` method.

</Tab>

<Tab value="Named Extractors">

```js
import {
  SoundCloudExtractor,
  AttachmentExtractor,
} from '@discord-player/extractor';

await player.extractors.loadMulti([SoundCloudExtractor, AttachmentExtractor]);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Callout>
  It is up to you to decide which extractors you want to use. Having too many
  extractors may slow down the query resolution process.
