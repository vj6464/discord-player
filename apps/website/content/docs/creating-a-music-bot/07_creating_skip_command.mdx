title: Creating a Skip Command
description: Learn how to create a skip command for your music bot
---

In this guide, we will learn how to create a skip command in your Discord bot using Discord Player. The skip command will skip the currently playing song in the voice channel.

## Design Planning

Before we dive into the code, let's plan the design of our skip command:

1. **Command Definition**: We will define a new slash command named `skip` using `SlashCommandBuilder`.
2. **Queue Retrieval**: We will use the `useQueue` hook to get the current queue.
3. **Playing Check**: We will check if there is a track currently playing.
4. **Skipping**: We will skip the current track using the `skip` method.
5. **Response**: We will send a confirmation message indicating the track has been skipped.

```js title="skip.js"
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';
import { useQueue } from 'discord-player';

export const data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName('skip') // Command name
  .setDescription('Skip the currently playing song'); // Command description

export async function execute(interaction) {
  // Get the current queue
  const queue = useQueue();

  if (!queue) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'This server does not have an active player session.',
    );
  }

  if (!queue.isPlaying()) {
    return interaction.reply('There is no track playing.');
  }

  // Skip the current track
  queue.node.skip();

  // Send a confirmation message
  return interaction.reply('The current song has been skipped.');
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab value='Without Player Context'>

```js title="skip.js"
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';
import { useQueue } from 'discord-player';

export const data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName('skip') // Command name
  .setDescription('Skip the currently playing song'); // Command description

export async function execute(interaction) {
  // Get the current queue
  const queue = useQueue(interaction.guild);

  if (!queue) {
    return interaction.reply(
      'This server does not have an active player session.',
    );
  }

  if (!queue.isPlaying()) {
    return interaction.reply('There is no track playing.');
  }

  // Skip the current track
  queue.node.skip();

  // Send a confirmation message
  return interaction.reply('The current song has been skipped.');
}
```

</Tab>

In this example:

- We define a new slash command named `skip` using `SlashCommandBuilder`.
- We use the `useQueue` hook to get the current queue.
- If there is no active player session, we reply with an appropriate message.
- We skip the current track using the `skip` method.
- We send a confirmation message after skipping the current song.
