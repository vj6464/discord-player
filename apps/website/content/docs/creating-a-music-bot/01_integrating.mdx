Discord Player is a powerful and easy-to-use music framework for Discord.js. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API to play music in your Discord bot. This guide will help you integrate Discord Player in your Discord bot.

## Installation

To create a music bot using Discord Player, you need to install discord-player and its dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```package-install
npm install discord-player @discord-player/extractor
```

<Callout>
  We are also installing `@discord-player/extractor` as it contains the default
  extractors for Discord Player which provides ability to play audio from local
  files, raw url or SoundCloud. **Discord Player on itself does not support
  anything.**
</Callout>

## Initialization

Discord Player works with both discord.js and Eris. You can initialize Discord Player based on the library you are using.

<Tabs items={['discord.js', 'eris']}>
<Tab value='discord.js'>

```js title="index.js"
import { Client } from 'discord.js';
import { Player } from 'discord-player';

const client = new Client({
  /* options */
});
const player = new Player(client);
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="eris">

```js title="index.js"
import Eris from 'eris';
import { Player, createErisCompat } from 'discord-player';

const client = Eris({
  /* options */
});
const player = new Player(createErisCompat(client));
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Callout type="warn">
  We don't recommend assigning `player` to `client` using `client.player =
  player` here. Discord Player provides [hooks](/docs/hooks/using_hooks) (aka
  helper functions) to access discord-player objects at ease.
</Callout>

That's it! You have successfully initialized Discord Player in your bot.

<Callout>
  Even though Discord Player supports Eris, the guide from here will focus on
  discord.js. You can refer to the [Eris
  documentation](https://abal.moe/Eris/docs) for more information on Eris
  specific APIs. Concept wise, both discord.js and Eris are similar.

In the next section, we will learn about extractors and how to integrate them to support audio streaming.
