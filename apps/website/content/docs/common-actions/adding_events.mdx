Player state changes get emitted as events. You can attach to a particular listener to keep track of them.

[List of all available events](/api/discord-player/types/GuildQueueEvents)

The most commonly used listeners and their sample implementation are listed below:

Add these in your `index.js` where you initialized the Discord Player instance

## General events

`queue.metadata.send()` is used here to send a message to the interaction channel.

<Callout type="info">
  For this example to work, you will need to pass `interaction.channel` as the
  metadata while executing the play command. Check the example below
</Callout>

```js title="events.js"
player.events.on('playerStart', (queue, track) => {
  // Emitted when the player starts to play a song
  queue.metadata.send(`Started playing: **${track.title}**`);
});

player.events.on('audioTrackAdd', (queue, track) => {
  // Emitted when the player adds a single song to its queue
  queue.metadata.send(`Track **${track.title}** queued`);
});

player.events.on('audioTracksAdd', (queue, track) => {
  // Emitted when the player adds multiple songs to its queue
  queue.metadata.send(`Multiple Track's queued`);
});

player.events.on('playerSkip', (queue, track) => {
  // Emitted when the audio player fails to load the stream for a song
  queue.metadata.send(`Skipping **${track.title}** due to an issue!`);
});

player.events.on('disconnect', (queue) => {
  // Emitted when the bot leaves the voice channel
  queue.metadata.send('Looks like my job here is done, leaving now!');
});
player.events.on('emptyChannel', (queue) => {
  // Emitted when the voice channel has been empty for the set threshold
  // Bot will automatically leave the voice channel with this event
  queue.metadata.send(`Leaving because no vc activity for the past 5 minutes`);
});
player.events.on('emptyQueue', (queue) => {
  // Emitted when the player queue has finished
  queue.metadata.send('Queue finished!');
});
```

```js title="play.js"
await player.play(channel, query, {
  nodeOptions: {
    metadata: interaction.channel,
  },
});
```

## Debug events

```js title="events.js"
player.on('debug', async (message) => {
  // Emitted when the player sends debug info
  // Useful for seeing what dependencies, extractors, etc are loaded
  console.log(`General player debug event: ${message}`);
});

player.events.on('debug', async (queue, message) => {
  // Emitted when the player queue sends debug info
  // Useful for seeing what state the current queue is at
  console.log(`Player debug event: ${message}`);
});
```

## Error events

```js title="events.js"
player.events.on('error', (queue, error) => {
  // Emitted when the player queue encounters error
  console.log(`General player error event: ${error.message}`);
  console.log(error);
});

player.events.on('playerError', (queue, error) => {
  // Emitted when the audio player errors while streaming audio track
  console.log(`Player error event: ${error.message}`);
  console.log(error);
});
```
