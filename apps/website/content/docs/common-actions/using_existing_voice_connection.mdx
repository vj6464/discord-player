  upon `player.play()` for queue creation, you need to manually create the
  queue. You can then use `queue.play()` instead to achieve `player.play()`

### joinVoiceChannel example

```js title="play.js"
import { joinVoiceChannel } from 'discord-voip'

const connection = joinVoiceChannel(...);

const queue = await player.nodes.create(guild, {...});

queue.createDispatcher(connection);

// now use the queue
const { track } = await queue.play(query, { options });
```

### getVoiceConnection example

```js title="play.js"
import { getVoiceConnection } from 'discord-voip'

const connection = getVoiceConnection(guildId);
const queue = await player.nodes.create(guild, {...});

queue.createDispatcher(connection);

// now use the queue
const { track } = await queue.play(query, { options });
```
