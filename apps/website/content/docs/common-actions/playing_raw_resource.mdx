description: Learn how to play a custom audio resource using Discord Player
---

Discord Player natively allows you to play custom audio resource.

```js title="play-raw.js"
import { createAudioResource } from 'discord-voip';

const resource = createAudioResource(...); // create audio resource

await player.play(resource); // play that resource
```

<Callout type="warn">
  If you do not plan on replaying the track, it is recommended to clear the
  assigned resource from the track to avoid memory leaks.
</Callout>

The following example demonstrates how to clear the resource from the track. You may also utilize the events to clear the resource when the track ends. You can use `track.hasResource` to determine if the track has a resource assigned.

```js title="play-raw.js"
const { track } = await player.play(resource); // play that resource

// clear the resource from the track
if (track.hasResource) {
  track.setResource(null);
}
```
