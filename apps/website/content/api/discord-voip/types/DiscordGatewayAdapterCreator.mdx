## DiscordGatewayAdapterCreator

A function used to build adapters. It accepts a methods parameter that contains functions that
can be called by the implementer when new data is received on its gateway connection. In return,
the implementer will return some methods that the library can call - e.g. to send messages on
the gateway, or to signal that the adapter can be removed.
